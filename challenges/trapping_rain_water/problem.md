# Challenge: Trapping Rain Water

## Problem
Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is `1`, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

## Example 1
```
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The map looks like:
       #
   #   ## #
_#_##_######
The water trapped is 1 unit at index 2, 1 at 4, 2 at 5, 1 at 6, 1 at 9 = Total 6.
```

## Example 2
```
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9
```
