# Challenge: Two Sum

## Problem
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the same element twice.

## Constraints
- Time Complexity: **O(n)** required. (An O(n^2) solution will fail the performance test).
- Space Complexity: O(n) allowed.

## Example 1
```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, so we return [0, 1].
```

## Example 2
```
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
```
