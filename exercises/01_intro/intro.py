intro.py - Welcome to Pylings!

This is your first exercise. The goal is simple: make the program output
"Hello, World!" to the console.

In Python, you use the `print()` function to display text:
    print("some text")

Your task: Remove the line that raises an exception, and add a print
statement that outputs exactly "Hello, World!"
"""


def main():
    # TODO: Add a print statement that outputs "Hello, World!"
    # Then delete the line below.
    raise Exception("Delete this line and add a print statement above!")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
