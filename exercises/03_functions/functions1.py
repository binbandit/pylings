"""
functions1.py - Defining Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code. You define them with the `def` keyword:

    def function_name():
        # code here
        print("Hello from function!")

To call (run) a function, use its name followed by parentheses:
    function_name()

Your task: Define a function named `call_me` that prints "Ring! Ring!".
The function is already being called in main() - you just need to create it.
